# My Favorite Movie GIF


#Description

This project was developed to help the user manage their workday. Users can enter to do's and events in the input fields of time blocks, view the current time and date. The finished project will provide color-coded blocks depending on whether an event is in the past, present, or future. An interactive icon is present in the time block in order for the user to save their input. In order to use the application, the user must click on the time block input field, enter their desired text, and click the floppy disc icon to save their data in local storage. This finished project will provide confirmation to the user that their input was saved. I used Bootstrap to style the application and Javascript for the logic.
