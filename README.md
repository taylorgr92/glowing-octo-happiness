# My Favorite Movie GIF


# Description

We made this application for movie lovers and GIF enthisiasts alike to express their adoration for their favorite films. It offers entertainment for the user as well as a good way to waste some time. In order to utilize the application the user must type their preferred movie title into the search bar on the top of the page. Upon clicking the 'search' button, 15 GIFS with the keyword of the movie title they entered will be pulled from the GIPHY API. In future iterations we wish to use the OMDB API to simultaneously render a movie poster. We also plan to enable the user to save their preferred GIF upon a double-click. The selected GIF will be added to a list through localStorage which will be rendered on a separate page which the user can view at any time. 

# Technologies used

HTML/CSS/Javascript are used for the page build and the Giphy API is used for the GIFS. Bulma framework is utilized for styling.
